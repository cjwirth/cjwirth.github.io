title: Snowglobe Thing Story

> I found this hiding in some files stored on an old hard drive. I'm not sure when I wrote it or why. It must have been either in high school or university, which would place it in in 2004-2011 or so.

A story about random stuff that is a combination of Myst and Stargate. Probably. 
I have no ideas of where this is going.

## Chapter 0: The Prequel

“With this, I guess I’ve finally finished!”

Reclining back in his chair, Nathan let out a well deserved sigh of relief. Finally taking off his glasses felt good as he looked down upon his creation. The small globe seemed vibrant with life, but Nathan knew that without his influence, none of the figures inside would do anything. In He gazed across the mountains in the globe, looked down to see the forest concealing the lake, and finally glanced at the town which, if he hadn’t known better, would have seemed to have been asleep. It made him realize how tired he actually was, and that he’d been working so long, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept.

Nathan got up to make his way to bed, but before he got too far, he noticed the device. The device that would actually make the sphere he had just created work – if the ancient books were correct, if he had translated the books correctly, and if he had actually managed to correctly build the globe. He was almost tempted to put the globe into the slot in the pedestal, then thought the better of it and decided that it would be best he retire for the night.

He got ready for bed after a quick meal, and when he walked into his bedroom, he noticed that Jennifer wasn’t in bed. He thought it strange until he heard the sound of the piano coming from downstairs. Instead of yelling down the stairs to tell her to quit playing, he just stood there, smiling. He’d fall asleep easier if she continued playing anyway.
Nathan went to sleep.

Jennifer finished making dinner, and thought it would be nice of her to deliver a plate to her husband in his study. He had been working so hard lately, it would do him good to have a good meal. Ever since he discovered these old books in the university library, Nathan hadn’t been teaching his classes or accompanying Jennifer to any of the town gatherings. Perhaps if she could eat with him, she could get through to him.

She walked into the Study, but Nathan hadn’t seemed to notice her. He slowly kept working until she heard him say something.

“With this, I guess I’ve finally finished!” Nathan said with a sigh.

Jennifer knew what this meant. He had just finished building whatever it was that had been occupying him for the past few weeks – or was it months? Regardless, he’d be dieing to use it as soon as he could. She decided to just leave his meal in the Dining Room.

What would it be that intrigued Nathan so much? What could it possibly be that kept such a reasonable man such as him up days on end just to complete? Jennifer figured that she wouldn’t be allowed to even so much as touch something he had worked so hard on.

Not if Nathan knew she was going to, at least…

She heard Nathan come out of the study and eat his dinner. She went over and began to play some songs on the piano. If she wanted to see what it was Nathan was working on so hard, she would have to get him to sleep. She began playing all of his favorite songs, hoping they would lull him to sleep.
